# Pre-requisites to learn Docker 
While "Docker" is often used because people are more familiar with the term, the core requirement is understanding the concept of containers. This means understanding:

- What containers bring into the picture
- How they are different from virtual machines
- Networking isolation
- Namespace isolation
- Why containers are lightweight
- How to secure containers (using distroless images, multi-stage Docker builds)

You should be strong with the basics of containers, not just simple Docker commands. It is assumed you have watched the previous videos or already understand these concepts before proceeding with Kubernetes.
