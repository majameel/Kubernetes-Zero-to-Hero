## ðŸš€ High-Level Advantages of Kubernetes over Docker

Kubernetes offers four fundamental advantages:

1. Kubernetes is by default **cluster in nature** or **cluster in behavior**.
2. Kubernetes offers **Auto healing**.
3. Kubernetes offers **Auto scaling**.
4. Kubernetes provides **enterprise-level support** like advanced load balancing, security, and networking.

> These enterprise-level supports are a major difference between Docker and Kubernetes.

## ðŸ§  Common Misconception in Kubernetes Architecture Explanations

Many videos state that Kubernetes has a:

- **Control Plane** (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager, cloud controller manager)
- **Data Plane** (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime)

But **just listing components doesnâ€™t help you understand the architecture**.

The source takes a comparative approach against Docker to explain each componentâ€™s advantage.

## ðŸ§± Simplest Components: Docker vs Kubernetes

- In **Docker**, the simplest unit is a **container**.
- In **Kubernetes**, itâ€™s a **Pod** â€“ a wrapper over your container that adds more capabilities.
